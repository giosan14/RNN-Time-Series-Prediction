## Activity Overview

In this activity, we will leverage the knowledge of RNNs to train models capable of predicting future values in time series data. Typically, time series forecasting tasks are performed using models like ARIMA. However, in this practice, we will explore how modeling with RNNs can be a viable alternative for such tasks.

### Key Steps:

1. **Dataset Retrieval:** Download and store the daily minimum temperature dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the dataset by organizing it into appropriate variables for training and validation. Additionally, create a windowed dataset to facilitate local analysis of the time series.

3. **Model Design:** Design a deep learning model for modeling the daily minimum temperature time series. The model will comprise layers such as Conv1D, LSTM, and Dense layers.

4. **Model Training:** Train the designed model using the preprocessed dataset. Utilize callbacks for dynamic learning rate adjustment during training.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE). Visualize the loss function to analyze model convergence.

6. **Learning Rate Adjustment:** Adjust the learning rate based on the initial training results and retrain the model.

7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to forecast future values of the time series. Visualize the predicted values and compare them with the actual data.

8. **Results Visualization:** Plot the loss function against epochs to analyze the training process's convergence and oscillation.
